MagicWords is an improved command line tool, that give you the ability to create 'Magic Word' that can run any program (with parameters), launch any url or files.

The user interface consists of a simple textbox, that is hidden in the tray bar by default, and that can be activated by pressing the CTRL-F12 combinaison.

The textbox has auto-completion, so you actually just need to type 2 or 3 letters to launch your application; which is the far more easy and instictive than desktop shortcuts or menus.

This application is inspired by the awesome SlickRun, and intend to give users an OpenSource alternative.
